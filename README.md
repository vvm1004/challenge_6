#Challenge: Notes App with Local Storage
Build a simple Notes App that allows users to:
- Add a new note (title, content)
- Edit an existing note
- Delete a note
- Search/filter notes by keyword
- Persist notes using Local Storage

##Technologies Used
- Use React.js with functional components
- Use React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Notes should be stored and retrieved from Local Storage
- Use Tailwind CSS (or your preferred UI framework: Antd, Material UI, Bootstrap)

###Goal of the Challenge:
- Practice component-based architecture
- Understand and manage local state with hooks
- Work with forms and input handling
- Perform CRUD operations
- Persist data locally
- Use conditional rendering and dynamic list rendering
